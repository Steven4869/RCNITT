          The Department of Energy and Environment (DEE) formerly, Centre for Energy and
          Environmental Science and Technology (CEESAT) was established at Regional Engineering
          College (present-day NITT) in 1995, under the auspices of UK â€“ India RECs Project: Energy
          Theme. CEESAT was renamed as Department of Energy and Environment in 2012.The mission of
          DEE is to develop solutions for a better energy and environmental future, through
          high-quality research and consultancy services in the areas of sustainable energy
          technologies, environmental pollution control, and energy and environmental audit. DEE
          harbours an NABL accredited calibration lab and ISO 9001:2008 certified state-of-the-art
          laboratories equipped with sophisticated instruments and software, with the objective of
          catering to academic and industrial research needs.The department is committed to convert
          its research outcomes into a real time technology transfer to the society and industry
          where it meets out its ultimate objective.
