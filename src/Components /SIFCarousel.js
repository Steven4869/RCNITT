      text: `UV-Vis spectroscopy is an analytical technique that measures the amount of discrete wavelengths of UV or visible light that are absorbed by or transmitted through a sample in comparison to a reference or blank sample. This property is influenced by the sample composition, potentially providing information on what is in the sample and at what concentration. `,

      text: `This technique is based upon the identification of functional groups within molecules where such groups vibrate (either through stretching or bending in various ways) when irradiated with specific wavelengths of light. These vibrations and their intensity (% transmission) are plotted against the frequency of light (cmâˆ’1) to which the sample is exposed to produce an FTIR spectrum. Portions of the FTIR spectrum are unique to the compound under test. `,
